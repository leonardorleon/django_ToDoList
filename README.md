# django_ToDoList

Working on a simple To-Do list application using django. I will update the readme as the app takes shape, for now:
* Basic functionality to create lists with items and update their status (completed/in progress)
* User authentication and login has been added
* Todo lists are now related to users, so they can only access their own todo lists
